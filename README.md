## Description ðŸ“”

In this project you can find .ipynb notebooks with code for training different versions of T5 model for text detoxification. There are python script to run already fine-tuned models, load the datasets, prepare visualising materials. There are also reports of research work done during the assignment

## How to start ðŸš€

In order to run all the script you have to do the following procedure:

1.  Clone this git repo to your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lumiwarum/detoxification/tree/main
```

1. Create a new python virtual environment and activate it

```bash
python3 -m venv /env
source /env/bin/activate
```

1. Install all the requrements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now youâ€™re ready to run all python script in this repo.

[Notebooks](https://www.notion.so/notebooks/) folder contains all the .ipynb file that I used during the research process

[The report](https://www.notion.so/Solution-Building-33f0b7d8aced43118f38d369a50fd137?pvs=21) about baseline and how I have approached the problem

[The report](https://www.notion.so/Final-Solution-a493a971f44a4ed8a85d203a366e7880?pvs=21) about my final model and overall evaluation is here

## Usage:

### Data processing:

1. [src/data/download_dataset.py](https://www.notion.so/Detoxification-Task-f978e900e9784df78e1baf34a3d94af8?pvs=21) - downloads the dataset and extracts it into `data/raw` directory.
2. [src/data/make_datasets.py](https://www.notion.so/Detoxification-Task-f978e900e9784df78e1baf34a3d94af8?pvs=21) - uses the download_dataset.py script and create a cropped processed dataset described in the reports

### Train model:

[src/models/train_model.py](https://www.notion.so/Detoxification-Task-f978e900e9784df78e1baf34a3d94af8?pvs=21) - fine-tunes the t5 from Skolkovo on the dataset made by make_dataset.py

### Predict:

[src/models/predict_model.py](https://www.notion.so/Task-description-588e0cb88be4416ea7311426b1d9b360?pvs=21) - allows you to run the model for detoxifying your sentence. If the model is not fine-tuned - the default model will be from the Skolkovo versio
