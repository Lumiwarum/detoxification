## Description ðŸ“”

In this project you can find .ipynb notebooks with code for training different versions of T5 model for text detoxification. There are python script to run already fine-tuned models, load the datasets, prepare visualising materials. There are also reports of research work done during the assignment

## How to start ðŸš€

In order to run all the script you have to do the following procedure:

1.  Clone this git repo to your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lumiwarum/detoxification/tree/main
```

1. Create a new python virtual environment and activate it

```bash
python3 -m venv /env
source /env/bin/activate
```

1. Install all the requrements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now youâ€™re ready to run all python script in this repo.

[Notebooks](https://github.com/Lumiwarum/detoxification/tree/main/notebooks) folder contains all the .ipynb file that I used during the research process

[The report](https://github.com/Lumiwarum/detoxification/blob/main/reports/Solution%20Building.md) about searching for the solution

[The report](https://github.com/Lumiwarum/detoxification/blob/main/reports/final%20solution.md) about my final model and overall evaluation is here

## Usage:

### Data processing:

1. [src/data/download_dataset.py](https://github.com/Lumiwarum/detoxification/blob/main/src/data/download_dataset.py) - downloads the dataset and extracts it into `data/raw` directory.
2. [src/data/make_datasets.py](https://github.com/Lumiwarum/detoxification/blob/main/src/data/make_datasets.py) - uses the download_dataset.py script and create a cropped processed dataset described in the reports

### Train model:

[src/models/train_model.py](https://github.com/Lumiwarum/detoxification/blob/main/src/models/train_model.py) - fine-tunes the t5 from Skolkovo on the dataset made by make_dataset.py

### Predict:

[src/models/predict_model.py](https://github.com/Lumiwarum/detoxification/blob/main/src/models/predict_model.py) - allows you to run the model for detoxifying your sentence. If the model is not fine-tuned - the default model will be from the Skolkovo versio

### Visualize:

[src/visualization/visualize.py](https://github.com/Lumiwarum/detoxification/blob/main/src/visualization/visualize.py) - allows to make figures from the intermediate dataset that are used in the reports
